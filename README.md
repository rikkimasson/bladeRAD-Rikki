# bladeRAD - Multi-functional Radar
This repository contains the necessary control scripts to use the Nuand bladeRF micro 2.0 Software Defined Radios as a multifunctional active and passive radar.  
SDRs provide highly flexible platforms that can be used to perform multiple functions at multiplefrequency bands through rapid reconfiguration of hardware via software. The cost-efficiency and ease of use make SDRs theoretically very suitable for experimental research in active and passive networked radar. The Nuand bladeRf micro 2.0 is a low cost highly capable SDR available on the COTS market
